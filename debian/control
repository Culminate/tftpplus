Description: Trivial file transfer protocol client
 Tftp is the user interface to the Internet TFTP (Trivial File Transfer
 Protocol), which allows users to transfer files to and from a remote machine.
 The remote host may be specified on the command line, in which case tftp uses
 host as the default host for future transfers.

Description: Trivial file transfer protocol server
 Tftpd is a server which supports the Internet Trivial File Transfer Protocol
 (RFC 783).  The TFTP server operates at the port indicated in the `tftp'
 service description; see services(5).  The server is normally started by
 inetd(8).
 Tftpd is not suitable for use with the PXE bootloader; for that,
 use atftpd or tftpd-hpa.
